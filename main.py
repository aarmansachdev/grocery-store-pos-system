    ### Improvements
    # 1. make barcode class static or singleton or something
    # 2. Create the disccount logic for coupons and membership
    # 3. Create the inhertence for different membership types
    # 4. Dictionary should be used somewhere, could instead ask students to have a writeup asking how we can replace a product class with a dictionary (name maps to price, quantity)
    # 5. make sure how POS interacts with db is consitent (eg. shouuld POS shouldn't directly modify product or membership objects but should do so through store_back_end, which calls the db, which calls the object method) Naming for methods also needs to be consistent
